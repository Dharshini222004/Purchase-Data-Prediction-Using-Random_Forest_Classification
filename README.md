## *Project description* : 
- *predicting Purchase Data Using Random Forest Classification*
  
## *Objective*:
- *Built a Random Forest Classification model to predict whether a user will make a purchase based on their age and estimated salary*.

## *Process*:
- *Preprocessed the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets and applying feature scaling for uniformity. Trained a Random Forest model with 10 decision trees using the entropy criterion. Evaluation and Results: Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and achieved an accuracy score. Tested the model with new user data to predict purchase behavior*.

## *Outcome*:
- *Successfully identified purchasing patterns and predicted user behavior based on input features*.

## *Tools and Libraries Used- Python Libraries*:
- *NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn. Algorithms: Random Forest Classifier. Metrics: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix. Preprocessing Tools: StandardScaler for feature scaling*.
